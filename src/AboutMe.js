                            <p>Iâ€™m a recent graduate from {queensCollege} in New York City with a B.A. in computer science.
                                Developing software and getting my feet wet with new libraries and frameworks such as {android}, {react} and {firebase} is one of my favorite hobbies.
                                To me, coding is an art and writing clean, concise, code that not only works but functions efficiently is what I strive for.
                                I love learning from experienced individuals and consider work an ongoing education.
                                <b> My primary goal</b> is to create something impactful with people that bring out the best in me.
                                When I'm away from the computer screen, I'm probably working out, hiking, or playing video games.
