                            <p>My participation as a web dev intern at WWNorton & Company allowed me to encounter challenging situations and encounter real world problems. During my time in WWNorton I was able to utilize reference source to incorporate register/log in function on StudySpace web pages. I assisted  securing StudySpace website for HTTPS. My Implementation of accessibility for the StudySpace page using PayPalâ€™s bootstrap accessibility plugin was successful. I was also responsible for completing site templates for the Norton StudySpace website using Visual Studios.</p>
                            <p>A challenge I encountered was being required to use a programming language as well as web dev concepts I was not familiar with. My first approach was to copy the code over to a sandbox created for me. I learned a bit of syntax using online resources and began experimenting by changing code where I did not fully understand what exact functionality was intended. By observing the the output from the changes made not only did I become familiar with the language and concepts but the conventions used at the company as well. Using this approach along with a bit of tutorials during my transportation rides, I felt like I definitely cut the learning curve to become productive as quick as possible.</p>
